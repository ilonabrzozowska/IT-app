\chapter{Project description}

\section{The Purpose of the Project}



\subsection{The User Business or Background of the Project Effort}

Our client - AppartMeans, aim to build housing estate, which needs housing cooperative software
system. In order to this new enterprise, AppartMeans sign alignment with housing cooperative
which has not used any software up to now. The software which needs to be developed should
enable full communication between housing cooperative and new residents to make AppartMeans
housing estate more modern and residents friendly. The board of AppartMeans decided to
improve customers satisfaction by providing website application for residents. The quality of
customers satisfaction should be measure of the time spending every month in our application.



\subsection{Goals of the Project}

The main goal is project and implementation of database application for purpose of account
management by housing association. Final product will be consist of two main parts: web
application (for residents) and desktop application (for administration). These applications
assure of:


\begin{itemize}
 
  \item Remove necessity face to face contact between house cooperative and resident
  \item  Automated and error-free calculating of bills
  \item Provide up-to-date flow of information between sides
  \item Enable review of all already paid bills, media usage and its price in every month
  \item Make the billing process paperless

\end{itemize}

Final applications should allow its users to do as much as possible things related with paying bills and communication, but should do it more friendly and less time-consuming. Residents should use our service because it simplifies managing their bills management, not because they have to. Therefore measure of success should be the time they are spending on functionalities not obligatory to them, like checking the history of bills or media usage instead of checking them manually.

\section{The Stakeholders}

\subsection{The Client}
The client can be either housing cooperatives,  house developer or house rental company. Our client is company AppartMeans whitch sign alignment with housing cooperative.

\subsection{Other Stakeholders}

\begin{enumerate} 
\item \textbf{Customers and users as a stakeholders} - Because housing management system will provide such functionality as gathering bills data, it is necessary to consult project with media suppliers (water, power, gas). The structure of each type of bill is essential for correct  accounting.
On the other hand, there is a certain need to consult project with future users. For example for establishing requirements for user functionality.


\item \textbf{People involved in developing product:}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Testers
	\item Developers
	\item System and database architects
	\item Domain specialist (people who knows housing industry)
	\item Sponsors
\end{itemize}
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{The Hands-On Users of the Product}
\begin{enumerate}
	\item  \textbf{Tenants} –  they will have possibilities to improve bills management. First of all – browsing bills, according to their date, type (water, power etc.). Moreover there will be functionality allowing to generate charts and figures based on bills. As a result user obtains graphical representation of his bills – how much he pays for particular medium in previous months or for example what is the share of gas bills in overall cost in current month.
            	In addition they will manage their own accounts (changing e-mails, password, sending/receiving messages).

	\item  \textbf{Housing administration} – apartments owner (not only person, but also company), who manages the system. He has privileges to add/remove users(tenants) and buildings he owns. For improving communications, he will send messages and notifications to tenants (for example about formal meeting, some reminders etc.). An administrator will be a person, who inputs the data about the bills.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Personas}

Management of houses rental company is a huge-scoped task.  That leads to partition of administrative duties. 
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Administrator in terms of entire system} - it means a person who will be dealing with database management and maintaining the system. He will focus on technical aspects of system.
\item Second group will be textbf{administrative employees} – they will be involve in billing the tenants and delivering them various information, e.g. meetings, renovations . They needs to be familiar with system’s main functionalities, so probably there will be a need of special user training for them.
The separate user group will be tenants. Just people interested in making their lives easier by using e-system that allows to monitor and analyze their mortgage, bills. If one of housing agency goal will be mandatory use of the system, there should be a special user training also for the tenants.
\end{itemize}


\subsection{Priorities Assigned to Users}

The goal of using housing management system is to simplify the business activities of owners. They need to have a practical tool that will fulfill that goal. Because they are customers and “customer is always right”, they will be the most important users. The feedback of housing administration will determine if the project is useful and in the end – successful.
On the other hand – tenants attitude to user application will be very important. Simple and user-friendly interface, helpful functionalities – that will be the factor that will draw their attention.


\subsection{User Participation}

As a result of previous description and a fact, that success of this project depends on customers and users satisfaction, the research of their needs should be done. Many functionalities may be implemented after consults with them.
It is especially important, because different housing cooperatives can have different needs. It may appear, that some functionalities should be implemented as a exchangeable plug-ins.


\subsection{Maintenance Users and Service Technicians}

In order to ensure system stability and high service availability, system admin will provide software maintenance. On the other hand company itself should hire technician (if they decide to maintain their own hardware) and database administrator or person responsible for data maintenance. Of course it can be avoided by provide them such kind of service.
Database administration can be provided by OUR company as a part of helpdesk.



\section{Mandated Constraints}
\subsection{Solution Constraints}

The project should be done in programming language named \texttt{C\#} using .NET framework in order to assure neat and minimalist interface – because of embedded well-designed libraries. Accordingly it is necessary to use Model View Controller for Web Application and Windows Presentation Foundation for Desktop Application.

To insure excellent quality of our software from the very beginning of programming, we are going to work in Test-Driven Development. All this work will be organizing in Microsoft Visual Studio. This is very popular IDE facilitates quick start and reliable during work.

\subsection{Implementation Environment of the Current System}

Administration of Council House has up to now three PC’s. We have to assure access to external providers (like gas and water provide) and create local database (Internal server at Figure \ref{fig:implementation_environment}).

The council house consist of two buildings, where are dwell residents. They hold a connection between Administration of Council House by Server, which is encrypted from two sided.

\caption{Implementation Environment}
\label{fig:implementation_environment}
\end{figure} 

\subsection{Partner or Collaborative Applications}

Our software will has to collaborate with i.a. gas and water provider. Their interfaces are not known so far.

\subsection{Off-the-Shelf Software}

To implements some of the requirements for the product we have to use some open source software mentioned in 3a. Solution Constraints – like Microsoft Visual Studio or .NET frameworks.


\subsection{Anticipated Workplace Environment}

The end users of our applications are residents of council house. Thus they will be work and use this product in their flats. The power sockets are in all the flat, but we know close to nothing about computer equipment of the residents. The workplace of Administration of Council House is located in a few rooms. The required source of power and Internet are provided.

\subsection{Schedule Constraints}

This project starts on 10th March 2015 and ends 20th July 2015.
Tasks are dived on 5 types, which every of them has its own deadline.
Accurate state deadline limitations are given at the table below.

\caption{Deadlines}
\label{tab:deadlines}
\end{table}

If we do not build the product by the end of the July, we have to contact with our client to set new dates.  

The financial impact of not having the product by the beginning of 2016 will be cost us 50\% price of this product.

\subsection{Budget Constraints}

The budget for the project is 100 000 PLN. There are 7 persons included, which overall predicted effort is about 1 500 hours. Is is required to obtain two laptops and assure catering.

\subsection{Enterprise Constraints}

There are 7 persons which can create this project. If the deadlines will be exceeded, we are obliged to hire at least one more person. These people can work at most 12 work a day, but no longer than for 3 days in a row. Standard work time is 8 days a day, but some of us work in another projects as well.

\end{table}

\section{Relevant Facts and Assumptions}
\subsection{Relevant Facts}

\begin{enumerate}
\item \textbf{Accounting bills} is a functionality realized by housing cooperative owner. In fact, he may not receive all the bills, so there should be a possibility to make an agreement with e.g. power provider and use their API.
\item \textbf{Security of personal data} should be considered. Personal and business information of tenants are confidential – every use of them in the system should be legal.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Business Rules}

Company willingness of using this product is only a small part of way to success. Also the future users (tenants) should be satisfied.

\subsection{Assumptions}

\begin{itemize}
\item  Software for users should be system independent. Good way to achieve this is to realize client interface as a web service.
\item The final product will be still developed after finalizing the transaction. It is very important to make this kind of software up-to-date.
\item Any major changes will be consulted with current customers.
\item Because the project scope is dependent on client will, the most of functionalities should be implemented as a plug-ins.


\end{itemize}

\section{The Scope of the Work}
\subsection{The Current Situation}

Existing business processes are mainly manual so there is a need 
to automate process of sending, analysing and managing of bills, 
improvement of system of making announcements regarding community is 
also demanded. Currently, there is few people attempting surveys and 
voting, making the process easier will make people more cooperative.

\caption{Plan of work with exact dates in form of Gantt chart}
\label{fig:gantt_chart}
\end{figure} 

\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Design of database and interface of an application} 
  \newline Firstly there is a need to create design of datebase as a ERD diagram to implement it afterwards. In the same time interface of an application shoud be considered to be user-friendly, professional, easy and efficient. Interface of an application for users is especially important. For administrators it doesn't have to be that much spectacular. 

  \item \textbf{Backbone structure of WPF application} 
    \newline
     Then, a graphical subsystem for rendering user-interfaces in applications using Microsoft Windows called Windows Presentation Foundation is chosen and backbone structure of application is created. 

  \item \textbf{Adding and deleting users and buildings} 
    \newline These are very important features that should be applied, because the application is about users, buildings and bills. 

  \item \textbf{Admin's management system} 
    \newline It includes all bills that should be sent to users. There are some quotients inputed by admin such as cost per \(1m^2\) of water etc., amount of (for example) water used by particular residents, button to generate total amount of money and sending a bill via email or/and to user's application.

  \item \textbf{Sending bills to users} 
    \newline Sending bills to users by email, storing it in database, access by user to data via apllication.
  
  \item \textbf{Sending notifications from admin to users in particular building} 
    \newline Sometimes there is a need to send notification. For example resident have to be present at home in particular time because of water meter replacement and sending notification is more efficient than sticking announcement on a paper somewhere on the wall in the buildings. 
  
  \item \textbf{Backbone structure of application ASP.NET} 
    \newline Than server - side Web application framework designed for Web development to produce dynamic Web pages called ASP .NET is chosen and backbone structure of application is created.
  
  \item \textbf{Table to browse bills in particular month} 
    \newline There is a feature that help users to measure, manage and estimate the usage of for example water. 
  
  \item \textbf{Logging to application ASP.NET} 
    \newline This is a feature that includes users names and hashes of the passwords in database and system of logging to application. It allows to users identification, authentication and authorisation with the high level of security and personal data protection.

\chapter{Project estimation}

Estimation process is important, but also difficult. In estimation of this product change of requirements and young age of team members will take great matter. Team members are inexperienced and for all of them this project is first on a big scale. Another issue of estimation for house cooperative software is fact that it's immaterial goods. WBS created below should help with estimation process - small tasks are much easier to estimate than whole software creation procedure. 

\section{Work breakdown structure}
As Gantt chart give a look for exact division of all implementation tasks. Presented below WBS (work breakdown structure) presents all tasks which have to be considered during all project procedures (from planning until maintaining).

\begin{figure}[H]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=1\textwidth]{img/WBS.png}
\caption{Work Breakdown Structure in the table form and detailed plan of tasks realization}
\label{fig:WBS}
\end{figure} 

\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Consulting} – contact with client to exchange information about technic aspects regarding costs and database’s speed and how interface should like.

  \item \textbf{Planning} – plan of the effort and time estimation. Moreover, creating backbone structures for desktop and web application. 

  \item \textbf{Implementation bases} – focusing on very primary requirements to enable implementation of secondary features. 

  \item \textbf{Testing} – however this project is based on Test Driven Development, at the end of the implementation process should be making some bug fixing and integration tests.

  \item \textbf{Delivering} – spending some time to give the software to the clients, getting feedback and making improvement. These tasks can be done parallely. 
\end{itemize}

\section{Function Points estimation}

It is not a big application so counting unadjusted function-point will be in small range. That's means that total weight in many factors will be having small parcel weights (in interval 1-3). Starting from functionality of software - It has to be considered - what exactly software has to be able to do. This functions are grouped in five categories (below table \ref{tab:func_pts_cat}).

\begin{table}[H]
	\centering
\begin{tabular}{|l|l|l|}
\hline
\rowcolor{pink!80!}\textbf{Category}& \textbf{Multiplier} & \textbf{Weight} \\ \hline
External Inputs          & 3          & 2      \\ \hline
External Outputs         & 1          & 1      \\ \hline
External Inquiries       & 3          & 1      \\ \hline
Internal Logical Files   & 2          & 2      \\ \hline
External Interface Files & 2          & 2      \\ \hline
\end{tabular}
\caption{Function Points categories with complexity and weight of tasks}
 \label{tab:func_pts_cat}
\end{table}

  \begin{enumerate}

 \item\textbf{Transactional Functions:}
   \begin{itemize} 
  \item \textit{External Inputs} - It stands for data collected as listed usage of gas, electricity, water and media bills in a database.
  \item \textit{External Outputs} - It is function of exportation data from application into pdf form.
  \item \textit{External Inquiries} - The system is requested for one thing, comined bill of usage electricity, whater etc.
  \end{itemize}
  
\item\textbf{Data Functions:}
  \begin{itemize}
  \item \textit{Internal Logical Files} - It is data collected from users (residents of house cooperative buildings) stored as tables with listed usage of gas, electricity, water and media bills in a database.
  \item \textit{External Interface Files} - Group of logically related data, in this project is content of database owned by house-cooperative web application. Residents data have to available for both sides (users and administrator).
  \end{itemize}  
 
  \end{enumerate}

To check how many functional points have created software, there is a need to multiply all transactional and data functions complexity (in \textit{Multiplier} column) by its weight for get FP of final product.

\[
FP = (3\ast2 )+(1\ast1)(3\ast1)+(2\ast2)+(2\ast2)= \textbf{18}
\]

After getting amount of functional points it is necessary to check how many hours in $C\#$ language is taken for each FP.  Some sources prove that one function point is an equivalent of eight hours of work in in $C\#$. There is a need of final multiplication to get needed amount of time.

\[
18\ast8 =  \textbf{144[hours]}
\]

\section{Detailed plan of realization and ProjectCodeMeter analysis}

Coding procedure will take approximatly 45 days.  The total work that should be done require about 61 working days:
\begin{enumerate}
  \item \textbf{Consulting} takes 9.5 days
  
  \begin{itemize}
  \item contact with clients
  \item calculating time and effort
  \end{itemize}

  \item \textbf{Planning} takes 11.38 days 
  
  \begin{itemize}
  \item creating backbone structures
  \item taking into account many implication and hard to predict tasks
  \end{itemize}
  
  \item \textbf{Implementation} takes 20 days 
 
  \begin{itemize}
  \item implementing e. g. admin’s management system, adding and deleting users and buildings,
	analysis of paying bills, account and database management

  \end{itemize}

  \item \textbf{Testing}  takes 6 days 
  
  \begin{itemize}
  \item integration tests and bug fixing using Sonar environmental
  \end{itemize}
  
  \item \textbf{Delivering} takes 14 days
  
  \begin{itemize}
  \item contact with client to get finish version of the software and getting feedback was went wrong
  \end{itemize}
  
  Any of tasks can start if and only if the last is ended. (For example planning can be started if consulting is done). It looks like waterfall, but providing Test Driven Development as well. This is an assurance, that there will be no reason to move back to the previous ones. 
  
\end{enumerate}

\caption{Risk list}
\end{table}

Source of risk can come from scope, schedule, stakeholder expectations, internal dependencies, security, integration, interoperability, implementation challenges, but they can be considered more generally as a source connected with people, process, technology or environment.  Due to the fact that our company starts up in IT business, most of the events that may occur with negative impact on the project’s ability to achieve performance and goals, may come from the inexperienced team members in many domains. The other important fact is that our company has short period of time, it is 4 months, to complete the project. Every change to the schedule may results in crossing the deadline.

\section{Risk Management Plan}

The Project Manager has overall responsibility for managing project risk. To make team member aware of risk through all phases of the project are organised special scheduled project meetings related to that topic. Project team members are responsible on that meeting for reporting to the project manager about potential occurrence of risk situations. If any risk factors or event will occur during the project which needs immediate attention, it should be reported via email to the project manager. The project manager is responsible for determining whether any of the identified risk factors or events requires further increased attention. New risk will be included in the risk register. Each notification in the risk register includes following elements: description of the risk event; probability that event will occur; cost, quality or schedule impact. Depending on the probability of risk occurrence and overall impact to the project are considered two possible reactions: attempt to mitigate the chance of occurrence and contingency actions after appearance of the risk factor.

Risk assessment consists of two factors: probability of occurrence and estimation of the impact on project. Both are described by numerical values from 1 to 5, which are corresponded to the factors in the following way:

\begin{table}[H]

	\end{tabular}
	\caption{Estimation of the impact}
}
\end{table}

By adding those two numbers it is possible to compare importance of particular risks and focus on avoiding occurrence of the more important ones. The other ones with lower values are more acceptable and in that case will be taken steps to minimalize impact after occurrence. Risk with value 8 or more are considered as risks with highly importance, with value between 5 and 7 as risks with middle importance and with value lower or equal to 4 as a risk with low importance.
